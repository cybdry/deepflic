    "<div class='alert alert-block alert-info'>The following project  is named ***Deepflic*** . This project aims to design a multi-camera distributed system connected to an central processor to recognize faces and send an alert message to the central system when one of the cameras detects a wanted person by police.The central processor must able to get information from distributed cameras and and broadcasting information to these cameras.\n",

    "The following related libraries will be needed for the project:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **opencv-python:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. The document describes the so-called OpenCV 2.x API, which is essentially a C++ API, as opposed to the C-based OpenCV 1.x API (C API is deprecated and not tested with \"C\" compiler since OpenCV 2.4 release.\n",
    "    - ***pip install opencv-python***\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **opencv-contrib-python:** opencv \"extra\" modules, contributed functionality. New modules quite often do not have stable API, and they are not well-tested.It should be noted that OpenCV requires numpy has been installed when installing opencv-contrib-python\n",
    "    - ***pip install opencv-contrib-python***\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **numpy:** This library is a dependency of OpenCV's Python bindings.It provides numeric computing functionality, including efficient arrays.\n",
    "    - ***pip install numpy***\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **scipy:** This library is a scientific computing library that is closely related to NumPy. It is not required by OpenCV, but it is useful for manipulating datain OpenCV images.\n",
    "    - ***pip install scipy***\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.It should be noted that matplotlib requires kiwisolver , pyparsing , six ,cycler , and python-dateutil.\n",
    "    - ***pip install matplotlib***\n",
    "- **pyqt5:** PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.\n",
