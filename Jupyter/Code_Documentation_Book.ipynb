This project aims to design a multi-camera distributed system connected to an central processor to recognize faces and send an alert message to the central system when one of the cameras detects a wanted person by police.The central processor must able to get information from distributed cameras and and broadcasting information to these cameras.\n",

    "- **opencv-python:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. The document describes the so-called OpenCV 2.x API, which is essentially a C++ API, as opposed to the C-based OpenCV 1.x API (C API is deprecated and not tested with \"C\" compiler since OpenCV 2.4 release.\n",
